# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a new project directory. As the project develops, this file should be updated with:

1. **Build and Development Commands**: Add specific commands for building, running, and testing the project once they are established.

2. **Architecture and Structure**: Document the high-level architecture and key design decisions as the codebase grows.

## Notes

- This file should be updated as the project structure and requirements become clearer.
- When adding new sections, focus on information that requires understanding multiple files or isn't immediately obvious from the code structure.
